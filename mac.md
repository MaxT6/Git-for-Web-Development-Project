## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? It is a version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Is the repositroy that users can upload their different brances(versions) of a projected.
3. Why do we create a branch? A branch allows multiple people to work on one project at the same time while not impacting the other's work.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To pull a stored repo from Github
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout followed by the name of the branch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git pull will take a project from git, a git fetch will only update the meta data of a project and not the code, and a git merge will merge the branch back to the main repository. 
7. What is a merge conflict? When two or more differt branches are pushed back to the same origianly repository. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? The developers will have to analyze the different branches that were pushed and dicided which branch, or parts of a branch they wish to keep.
